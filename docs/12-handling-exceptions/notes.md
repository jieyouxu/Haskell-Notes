# Handling Exceptions

!!! note "Exceptions"
    The *exceptions* here refers to exceptional cases such as invalid inputs,
    and not `Exception`s in languages like Java.

!!! note "Exceptions and control flow"
    Exceptions in languages like Java have the problem of interfering with
    control flow and causes the Exception to propagate.
